# autotoon

Convert webcam streams into cartoons

## Building

Build OpenCV for Java using [their instructions](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/desktop_java/java_dev_intro.html). Then, once it's built, copy all the files from the resulting `build/bin` and `build/lib` folders into Autotoon's `lib` folder.

Once the OpenCV dependencies are installed, from the main autotoon folder simply run `make && ./run` to build and run the program.
